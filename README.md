This is an Express.js app to review and retweet anagram matches found by 
[another project I wrote](https://github.com/bdrupieski/AnagramFinder).

Anagrams are retweeted to **[@anagrammatweest](https://twitter.com/anagrammatweest)**
and posted to **[tumblr](http://anagrammatweest.tumblr.com/)**.

I wrote 
[a blog post showing off this app](http://blog.briandrupieski.com/building-twitter-bot-to-retweet-anagrams).

I also wrote 
[a post on how to score anagrams](http://blog.briandrupieski.com/finding-anagrams-on-twitter).
